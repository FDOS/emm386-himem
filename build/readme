Warning!

Before building, you should apply patch for sources from EMM-BLD.DIF.
For this, go into SOURCE\EMM386 directory and run next command:

patch -fZp1<build\emm-bld.dif

or apply patch manually. This patch fixes warning messages and mismatched
variable name ("UMBOldhandler" in .C and "UMBoldhandler" in .ASM). Also,
you may remove in SOURCE\EMM386 directory unused files - MAKEFILE, BUILD.BAT
and LIBM.LIB.

*Vmware uses EC00-EFFF area, may not be included as UMBspace
 (same is valid for MS emm386). This is hardcoded!!! 
 (I=EC00-EFFF won't have effect in VMware)
 Area E800-EBFF has to be included manually

*VMware uses CA00-CAFF area for SCSI controller. 
 If SCSI (LSI Logic 53C1030 or NCR875) selected,
 you're out of luck. Thus, don't include C800-CBFF.

*Note the license. It's NOT the GPL, but the Artistic License.
 
-------------------

added options are:
/X           disables E820 memory detection.
/MAX:xxxx    (xxxx in KiloBytes, probably upper value of 4096000 as that is all
             that 32bit software can handle)
/NOABOVE16   modified, disables E801 function calls. 
             May be used together with /X if wanted.
/METHOD:     select only 1 out of: ALWAYSON, BIOS, FAST, PS2, KBC, PORT92

also, HIMEMSM has been removed. It has no support for XMS over 64MB.
Use /X /NOABOVE16 to get the same behaviour.
